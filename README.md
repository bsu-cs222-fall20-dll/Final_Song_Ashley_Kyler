Description:

This code is built to be a card game called "21." The game is set up as one player game, that being because the other opponent is the computer. 
The game uses a standard deck of cards. The goal is to get 21, or as close to 21 as possible, before the computer does. 
The player wants to have a higher number than the computer, but not exceed 21. If the player succeeds, they win. 
Each card has their worth for counting. Numbered cards 1 through 10 equal what their number are, face cards equal 10, and the Ace can be one or 11, the player decides.
In order to get 21, the player has to add their cards together. An example of that would be a 5 card and a 7 card, they add up to 12.
The player will be dealt two cards to begin their turn. If the player thinks their cards do not equal 21, they can draw another card to add to their stack.
If the player goes over 21, they "Bust," meaning that they computer wins by default.
